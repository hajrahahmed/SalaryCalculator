<h2>Salary Calculator</h2>

A responsive web application which calculates net salary with breakdowns including Monthly,
Weekly, Daily, and Hourly salary figures and tax contributions. The web application was
containerised using Docker for seamless deployment into the cloud. This project not only enhanced
my technical skills but also solidified my understanding of cloud infrastructure and deployment
methodologies.
